I'm the place you store your watched content for later rememberance, sadly I am still in my infancy. I aspire to be easily self hosted.

I am built with Go and Svelte(Kit).

Feel free to abuse this demo instance (nicely), which runs on the latest `dev` build: [https://watcharr.lab.sbond.co/](https://watcharr.lab.sbond.co/)
